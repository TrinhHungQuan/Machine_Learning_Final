Question 1:The optimization methods:
1)	Gradient Descent
2)	Momentum
3)	Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)
4)	RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)
5)	Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
Program with a data set of your choice, test these methods and compare them.

Question 2: Stock Price Prediction Problem (Opening Price) Based on the Following Information:
•	Opening price, closing price, and trading volume from previous days.
•	Industry type of the stock.
•	Time of the year (e.g., by day, by month).
•	Some macroeconomic indicators: self-selected from reliable sources (e.g., GDP, price indices, etc.).
Perform:
1.	Experiment with the following methods:
  o	Feedforward Neural Network
  o	Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  o	Other algorithms: Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
2.	Apply techniques to prevent overfitting and plot training graphs.
3.	Evaluate the models and compare them, plotting the results.

Question 3: Deep Machine Learning Method:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer, etc... program applying the chosen model to a classification problem.
